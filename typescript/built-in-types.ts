// 
// Variables can be declared using const similar to var or let declarations. The const makes a variable a constant where its value cannot be changed. Const variables have the same scoping rules as let variables.

let userDateOfBirth: Date new Date(12, 12, 12);

// The let declarations follow the same syntax as var declarations. Unlike variables declared with var, variables declared with let have a block-scope. This means that the scope of let variables is limited to their containing block, e.g. function, if else block or loop block. Consider the following example.
// const nameOfVariable: Date = null;


// 1. declare a variable 'var' for each of the built-in types and assign a value
// 2. declare a variable 'let' for each of the built-in types and assign a value
// 3. declare a constant 'const' for each of the built-in types and assign a value

var userName: string = 'Dave';
var userName: string = 'Dave';

console.log(userDateOfBirth);
